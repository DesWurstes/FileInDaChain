# FileInDaChain

A CLI tool to upload *any* data shorter than 90 kB to the blockchain.

Uses Omni's Class B transactions (can you spot the difference?) and OP_RETURNs,
depending on feasibility.

By using this software, you agree to not to upload/download anything illegal in any region!

Use it at your own risk!
